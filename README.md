## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User Guide

1. **Run the Script**

   After configuring the `.env` file, start the script. The following example is the command to start on the test network Sepolia:
   ```bash
   python3 TEST_Sepolia_Sniper.py
   ```

> **Note**: Different chains correspond to different scripts. Make sure to choose the correct script file when using.
- **ETH:** Use `ETH_Sniper.py`
- **BSC:** Use `BSC_Sniper.py`
- **BASE:** Use `BASE_Sniper.py`

> **Suggestion**: It is recommended to run the script on the test network **Sepolia** first to ensure everything is functioning properly before moving to the mainnet. A small amount of ETH test coins is required on Sepolia; you can refer to related testnet faucets for how to obtain them.

2. **Example Output**

   Upon successful execution, the script will output the following information:
   ```plaintext
   Private key loaded successfully.
   Successfully connected to the node.
   Trading parameters set up.
   Successfully loaded token contract address: 0x...
   Transaction completed, transaction hash: 0x...
   ```
